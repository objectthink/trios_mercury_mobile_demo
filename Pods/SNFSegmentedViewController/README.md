# SNFSegmentedViewController

SNFSegmentedViewController is the simplest way to use a `UISegmentedControl` for switching between views. You don't have to worry about view controller containment or setting up a kludge of custom empty segues. SNFSegmentedViewController just works.

## Usage

Since `SNFSegmentedViewController` is a subclass of `UITabBarController`, all you have to do is:
* Drag out a `UITabBarController` into a storyboard, and embed it in a `UINavigationController`.
* Wire it up to your views appropriately.
* Change its class to `SNFSegmentedViewController`.

It's that simple.

## Installation

Add `SNFSegmentedViewController` to your Podfile if you're using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), or add `SNFSegmentedViewController.{h,m}` into your project.

SNFSegmentedViewController requires iOS 6.0 and above, and it requires ARC.
